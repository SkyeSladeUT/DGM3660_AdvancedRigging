Rigging Script

Broken FK
select control -> then group
press button
gets selection
parent constrain only rotation
remove last letter (generally 1)
add _rotate
parent constrain only translation
remove last letter (generally 1)
add _translate
get child of group -> control
add attributes Rotate and Translate to control (set initial to 1)
connect the attributes to the parent constraint weights

Later work - be able to select multiple control/groups and perform this on all of them
connect it into the creating of controls

Other ideas - create a script that fixes joint orients on IK systems
